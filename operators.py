# Operators in Python
# Operators Type
# Arithmetic operator:+, -, *, /,%
# Relational operator:<,<=,>,>=,==,!,!=
# Logical operator:AND, OR, NOT
# Bitwise operator:&, |,<<,>>,-,^
# Assignment operator:=,+=,-=,^ * =,\%=
# identity operators:is,is not 
# Membership operators:in ,not in

 
# OPERATORS: These are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.
# OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.
# Arithmetic Operators:
# Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
a=15
b=4
# addition
print(a+b)
print(a-b)  # Subtraction
print(a*b)# Multiplication
print(a/b)# Division
print(a//b)# Floor Division
print(a%b) # Modulus
print(a**b)#Exponentiation
# comparison operators or relational operators:<,<=,>,>=,==,!,!=
# In Python Comparison of Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.
a = 13
b = 33
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a<=b)
print(a!=b)
print(a>=b)
# Logical Operators:AND, OR, NOT
# It is used to combine conditional statements.
print("/n")
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)#True if both statements are the same
print(a or b)#True if one of the statements is true.
print(not a)#Reverse the result
# Comparison Operators
#  Input two numbers and check if the first is greater than the second.
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a>b)
# : Input two strings and check if they are equal
s=input()
s1=input()
print(s==s1)
# Input an age and check if it is greater than or equal to 18
age=int(input())
print(age>=18)
