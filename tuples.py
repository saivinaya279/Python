# Here’s a clear and complete explanation of Tuples in Python 👇

#  Concept of Tuple in Python
# 🔹 Definition

# A tuple is an ordered, immutable (cannot be changed) collection of items in Python.
# It is used to store multiple items in a single variable, similar to a list — but once created, you can’t modify it.

# Syntax
# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)


# ✅ You can also create a tuple without parentheses:

# my_tuple = 1, 2, 3


# ✅ For a single-element tuple, you must include a comma:

# single = (5,)   # ✅ Tuple
# not_tuple = (5) # ❌ Just an integer

""" Characteristics of Tuples
# Property	Description
# Ordered	Elements have a defined order (index starts from 0).
# Immutable	You cannot modify (add, change, or delete) items after creation.
# Allow duplicates	Tuples can contain duplicate values.
# Can contain different data types	Numbers, strings, lists, etc."""
# Tuple Example
# student = ("Vinaya", 21, "Data Science", 8.7)
# print(student)


# Output:

# ('Vinaya', 21, 'Data Science', 8.7)

# Accessing Elements

# You can use indexing and slicing just like lists:

# t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# print(t[0])    # 10
# print(t[-1])   # 50
# print(t[1:4])  # (20, 30, 40)

""""Tuple Operations
# Operation	Example	Output
# Concatenation	(1,2) + (3,4)	(1, 2, 3, 4)
# Repetition	(1,2) * 3	(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
# Membership	3 in (1,2,3)	True
# Length	len((1,2,3))	3"""

"""Tuple Functions
# Function	Description	Example
# len()	Number of items	len(t)
# max()	Maximum value	max((1,5,2)) → 5
# min()	Minimum value	min((1,5,2)) → 1
# sum()	Sum of elements	sum((1,2,3)) → 6
# # tuple()	Converts list/string → tuple	tuple([1,2,3])"""
# """Tuple Packing and Unpacking""

# Packing:

person = ("Vinaya", 21, "Analyst")


# Unpacking:


name, age, role = person
print(name)  # Vinaya
print(age)   # 21
print(role)  # Analysts
"""Nested Tuples

Tuples can contain other tuples:"""

nested = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
