Given a string s, write a program to count the total number of consonants present in the string.

A consonant is any alphabetic character that is not a vowel (i.e., not ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, or ‘u’).
You should consider both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "Hello World"

Output:
7

Explanation:
The consonants are: H, l, l, W, r, l, d → total 7."""

Given two strings, s (the main string) and sub (the substring), write a program to find all the starting indices where the substring sub occurs in s.

The search should be case-sensitive and should include overlapping occurrences.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "ABCDCDC"
sub = "CDC"

Output:
[2, 4]

Explanation:
The substring "CDC" appears starting at indices 2 and 4 in the main string "ABCDCDC"."""
